Write this implementation specification for a senior frontend/full-stack
developer: be precise, mathematically rigorous, and visualization-focused.

## Product Vision

CompoundVision is a **sophisticated compound interest simulator and investment
planning tool** that makes the power (and risks) of compounding viscerally
visible. It goes far beyond "plug in a rate and see a curve" — it models
real-world conditions: market volatility, inflation erosion, tax drag, fee
compounding, dollar-cost averaging, and Monte Carlo scenarios. The goal is to
help users build intuition about how small changes in rate, fees, or
contribution timing create enormous differences over decades.

Treat every result as educational scenario analysis, not personalized financial,
tax, legal, or investment advice. Show assumptions, data sources and freshness,
uncertainty ranges, downside cases, fees, taxes, and model limitations alongside
results. Never present simulated or historical returns as guaranteed outcomes.

## Core Calculation Engine

### Fundamental Formula
All calculations are based on discrete compounding with configurable frequency:

```
FV = PV × (1 + r/n)^(n×t) + PMT × [((1 + r/n)^(n×t) - 1) / (r/n)]
```
Where: PV = present value, r = annual rate, n = compounding periods/year,
t = years, PMT = periodic contribution.

Engine MUST support:
- **Compounding frequencies**: daily (365), monthly (12), quarterly (4),
  semi-annual (2), annual (1), continuous (limit).
- **Contribution timing**: beginning of period (annuity due) or end (ordinary annuity).
- **Variable rates**: different rates per year/period (for scenario modeling).
- **All arithmetic in arbitrary precision** (use decimal.js or similar) —
  never floating point for financial math.

### Mark-to-Market Simulation

The real magic: show what compounding looks like under **actual market conditions**.

@match simulation_mode
  "deterministic" ==>
    #### Deterministic Scenarios
    - User inputs a fixed annual return (e.g., 7%).
    - Optional: model a single drawdown event (e.g., -40% in year 5, recover over 3 years).
    - Show the compounding curve with and without the drawdown overlaid.
    - Table view: year-by-year breakdown with columns:
      `Year | Start Balance | Contributions | Growth | End Balance | Total Contributed | Total Growth`

  "historical" ==>
    #### Historical Backtesting
    - User selects an asset class or index: S&P 500, NASDAQ, Total Bond Market,
      60/40 Portfolio, Gold, Real Estate (REIT index), Bitcoin.
    - System uses actual historical annual returns (stored in DB, 1928–present for S&P 500).
    - User picks a start year → system runs the simulation using real returns from that year forward.
    - **Sliding window**: show what happens if the user started in every possible year
      (e.g., 30-year outcomes starting 1928, 1929, ..., 1994). Display as a fan chart.
    - Highlight: best case, worst case, median outcome with dollar amounts.

  "montecarlo" ==>
    #### Monte Carlo Simulation
    - User specifies: expected annual return (μ), annual volatility (σ),
      assumed return distribution (normal or log-normal).
    - Engine runs N simulations (default 10,000), each sampling returns from the distribution.
    - Output:
      - **Fan chart**: percentile bands (5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 95th) over time.
      - **Probability table**: "Probability of reaching $X after Y years" for user-specified targets.
      - **Ruin probability**: chance of portfolio dropping below zero (relevant for withdrawal scenarios).
      - **Terminal wealth distribution**: histogram of final portfolio values.
    - Performance: 10,000 × 30-year simulations MUST complete in < 2 seconds (use Web Workers).

### Real-World Adjustments

@expand mode: context length: 80%
  #### Inflation Erosion
  - Toggle: show all values in nominal dollars or real (inflation-adjusted) dollars.
  - Default inflation rate: 3% (configurable).
  - Visualization: two overlaid curves — nominal vs real — with the gap labeled
    "purchasing power lost to inflation: $X".

  #### Tax Drag
  - Model three account types: taxable, tax-deferred (401k/IRA), tax-free (Roth).
  - Taxable: annual tax on dividends + tax on realized gains at withdrawal.
  - Tax rates: configurable (federal + state). Default: 22% income, 15% LTCG.
  - Show: pre-tax vs post-tax terminal value. The difference is the "tax drag."
  - Comparison mode: same investment across all 3 account types side-by-side.

  #### Fee Erosion
  - Expense ratio: annual percentage (e.g., 0.03% for index fund, 1.0% for active fund).
  - Advisory fee: separate annual percentage.
  - Applied daily: `daily_fee = annual_fee / 365`, deducted from portfolio each day.
  - **Fee impact visualizer**: show the dollar cost of fees over the full horizon.
    "A 1% annual fee costs you $X over 30 years on a $500/mo investment."
  - Comparison: same investment at 0.03% vs 0.50% vs 1.00% fees side-by-side.

  #### Dollar-Cost Averaging vs Lump Sum
  - Scenario A: invest $X as a lump sum today.
  - Scenario B: invest $X/12 monthly over one year, remainder grows at cash rate.
  - Historical comparison: run both strategies on every possible 12-month window.
  - Show: "Lump sum beats DCA X% of the time historically" with distribution chart.

## Investment Planning Tools

### Goal Planner
- User defines a goal: "I want $1,000,000 by age 60."
- Inputs: current age, current savings, expected annual contribution.
- Engine solves for: required rate of return, OR required monthly contribution,
  OR years needed (user picks which variable to solve for).
- Sensitivity table: "If your return is 1% lower, you need $Y more per month."

### Withdrawal Simulator (Retirement)
- User specifies: starting portfolio, annual withdrawal amount (or % rule),
  expected return, inflation rate, time horizon.
- 4% rule analysis: show probability of portfolio survival over 20/25/30/35/40 years.
- Dynamic withdrawal strategies:
  - Fixed dollar (inflation-adjusted).
  - Fixed percentage of current balance.
  - Guardrails (Guyton-Klinger): cut spending 10% if portfolio drops 20%,
    raise 10% if portfolio rises 20% above initial.
- Monte Carlo overlay: probability of ruin for each strategy.

### Portfolio Comparison Tool
- Compare up to 4 portfolio allocations side-by-side.
- Each portfolio: list of assets with allocation percentages.
- Run historical or Monte Carlo simulation on each.
- Metrics per portfolio: CAGR, max drawdown, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio,
  terminal value at 25th/50th/75th percentile.
- Visualization: overlaid growth curves with a shared time axis.

## Visualizations (Critical)

All charts MUST be **interactive** — hover for exact values, click to drill down,
pinch-to-zoom on mobile.

### Required Charts
1. **Growth Curve**: primary visualization. Log scale toggle. Annotations for
   contributions vs growth (stacked area). Milestone markers ("First $100K here").
2. **Fan Chart**: for Monte Carlo and historical sliding window. Gradient fill
   for percentile bands. Hover shows exact percentile values.
3. **Comparison Overlay**: up to 4 scenarios on one chart with legend toggle.
4. **Waterfall Chart**: for a single year — show starting balance, contribution,
   growth, fees, taxes, inflation → ending balance as a waterfall.
5. **Sensitivity Heatmap**: 2D grid (e.g., return rate × years) colored by outcome.
   Hover shows exact dollar amount. User picks the two axes.
6. **Distribution Histogram**: terminal wealth distribution from Monte Carlo.
   Overlay normal curve. Mark user's target with a vertical line.
7. **Fee Impact Bar**: dramatic horizontal bar showing total dollars lost to
   fees at different expense ratios.

### Shareable Results
- "Share this simulation" button generates a unique URL with all parameters encoded.
- URL contains no PII — only simulation parameters.
- Shared page: read-only interactive view with all charts.
- Export: PNG of any chart, CSV of any table, PDF report of full simulation.

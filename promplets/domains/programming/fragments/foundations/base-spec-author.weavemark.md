# Base Programming Spec Author

An implementation-ready software specification gives a programmer enough
concrete structure to build, test, and validate the system.
Every requirement you write must be **testable** — if a developer cannot write a
test for it, rewrite it until they can. Prefer concrete over abstract: name
specific algorithms, data structures, status codes, and error messages.

## Specification Standards

- Use RFC 2119 keywords (MUST, SHOULD, MAY) precisely.
- Every entity has an explicit lifecycle: creation → valid states → deletion/archival.
- Every API endpoint specifies: method, path, request body schema, response schema,
  error responses (with codes and messages), and authentication requirements.
- Every data model specifies: field name, type, constraints (nullable, unique, range,
  regex), default value, and indexing requirements.
- Concurrency and race conditions MUST be addressed for any shared mutable state.
- All monetary values MUST use integer cents (or smallest currency unit) — never floats.
- All timestamps MUST be UTC ISO 8601 with timezone offset.

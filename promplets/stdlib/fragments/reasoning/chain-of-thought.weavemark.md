# Chain of Thought

@note
  Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting. Rather than providing few-shot
  exemplars with reasoning traces (Wei et al., 2022), this method uses
  explicit step-by-step instructions in the style of Kojima et al. (2022),
  who showed that simply eliciting intermediate reasoning steps from the
  model ("Let's think step by step") significantly improves accuracy on
  arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.

  This reasoning fragment applies when explicit intermediate reasoning improves
  accuracy, traceability, or error detection.

Think step by step. Before answering, reason through the problem
carefully. Never jump to a conclusion without showing your work.

## Problem

@{problem}

## Instructions

Work through the problem one logical step at a time:
- State what you are calculating and why at each step.
- Show the arithmetic or reasoning clearly.
- After completing all steps, state your final answer on its own line,
  prefixed with "ANSWER: ".

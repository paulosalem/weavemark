# Self-Consistency Math Solver

@note
  Self-Consistency (Wang et al., 2022) improves Chain-of-Thought
  prompting by sampling multiple diverse reasoning paths at high
  temperature and selecting the most consistent answer via majority
  vote. The key insight is that complex problems admit multiple valid
  reasoning approaches, and the correct answer is more likely to
  emerge across independent paths than from a single greedy decode.
  The original paper reports +17.9% on GSM8K over standard CoT.

  This spec uses @refine to inherit the CoT baseline prompt, then
  runs it 5 times independently and votes over the final `ANSWER:` lines.
